# Tava App

## Overview

Tava App is a mini-project that leverages large language models for question answering and language translation. It provides users with the ability to interact with two powerful functionalities:

1. **Question Answering:** Utilizing the Google/Flax-T5-XXL model, Tava App enables users to input questions and receive accurate answers.

2. **Language Translation:** Powered by the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-{target_language} model, the app allows users to translate text between English and various target languages, including Malayalam, French, and more.

## Features

- **Question Answering:**
  - Enter a question in English, and the app will provide a detailed answer.
  
- **Language Translation:**
  - Translate text from English to various target languages and vice versa.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Tava-App.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application.

```bash
python myapp.py
```
