Train the YOLO model using our own dataset for detecting specific part from images.

1) run the resize_rotate.py file by giving the images(data *) you have
2) run the generate_doc_set.py file by giving results from the first script (rotated_resized_imgs)
3) run the final_set.py file by giving the previous outputs and also create few background images , you can download from google named 'background images'.

finally we will get a folder final_set which contains images and masks, we need images. Then we split it using a python script named 
Datasplit.py

Finally we have -a dataset like images-train
                                      - val
                                labels - train
                                       - val
then by creating the yaml file of the data you can train the YOLO model.
