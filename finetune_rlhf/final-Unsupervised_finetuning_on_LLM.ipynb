The first automobiles were powered by steam engines, but these were soon replaced by internal combustion engines, which proved to be more efficient and reliable. Karl Benz is often credited with creating the first true automobile in 1885, which was powered by a gasoline engine. This marked the beginning of a revolution in personal and commercial transportation.\n\nMass Production and the Model T:\n\nA significant milestone in the automobile industry was the introduction of mass production techniques by Henry Ford in the early 20th century. Ford's Model T, launched in 1908, became the first affordable car for the average American. The assembly line production method not only reduced the cost of manufacturing but also significantly increased the speed of production. By 1927, Ford had produced over 15 million Model T cars, making it the best-selling car of its time.\n\nTechnological Advancements:\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the automobile industry witnessed numerous technological advancements. The introduction of electric starters, automatic transmissions, and power steering greatly improved the convenience and safety of driving. The development of safety features such as seat belts, airbags, and anti-lock braking systems (ABS) also contributed to making cars safer for occupants.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns and Fuel Efficiency:\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, growing concerns about environmental pollution and fuel efficiency led to significant changes in the industry. The oil crisis of the 1970s prompted automakers to focus on producing smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. The introduction of catalytic converters and stricter emissions standards helped reduce the environmental impact of automobiles.\n\nThe Rise of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles:\n\nThe 21st century has seen a renewed focus on reducing the environmental footprint of automobiles. Electric and hybrid vehicles have become increasingly popular as technology has improved and concerns about climate change have grown. Companies like Tesla have revolutionized the market with high-performance electric vehicles (EVs) that offer long driving ranges and advanced features. Traditional automakers are also investing heavily in EV technology, with many planning to phase out internal combustion engines entirely in the coming decades.\n\nAutonomous Driving and the Future:\n\nThe future of the automobile industry is likely to be shaped by advancements in autonomous driving technology. Companies like Waymo, Uber, and Tesla are developing self-driving cars that promise to revolutionize transportation by reducing accidents, improving traffic flow, and providing new mobility options for those unable to drive. While fully autonomous vehicles are not yet widespread, ongoing developments suggest that they could become a common sight on our roads in the not-too-distant future.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe automobile industry has undergone tremendous changes since the first cars were invented. From the early days of steam-powered vehicles to the latest advancements in electric and autonomous driving technology, the industry continues to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of consumers and address global challenges. As we move forward, the focus on sustainability and innovation will likely drive the next wave of transformations in this dynamic industry.\n\n\"\"\"\n# Open the file in write mode\nwith open(file_path, 'w') as file:\n    # Write content to the file\n    file.write(text_content)\n     \nprint(f\"File '{file_path}' created successfully.\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-06T08:37:54.828729Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-06T08:37:54.828997Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-06T08:37:54.843937Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-06T08:37:54.828973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-06T08:37:54.843002Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"File 'new_file.txt' created successfully.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"with open(\"/kaggle/working/new_file.txt\",\"rb\") as file:\n    result = file.read()\nprint(result)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-06T08:37:57.066559Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-06T08:37:57.066924Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-06T08:37:57.072289Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-06T08:37:57.066896Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-06T08:37:57.071278Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"b\"\\nThe Evolution of the Automobile Industry\\n\\nEarly Innovations:\\n\\nThe automobile industry has come a long way since its inception in the late 19th century.

The increasing pollution concerns have led to a need for more efficient cars and trucks. The automobile industry has responded by producing cars and trucks with higher fuel efficiency.\n\nThe early cars had a high fuel efficiency due to their design and construction. The internal combustion engines of those days were very efficient, and many cars of that time had over 20 mpg (million pounds per square inch) of efficiency. The war made use of more efficient engines, and cars with aluminum alloy bodies and lighter materials became more and more common.\n\nModern Technology and Fuel Type Efficiency\n\nFuel type efficiency is also a major concern of the modern era. Fuel cells and electric vehicles are becoming more and more common as technology improves. The latest vehicles often have high fuel efficiency due to their design and construction.\n\nThe advent of electric vehicles has greatly increased fuel efficiency. Many modern cars and trucks have over 100 mpg (million pounds per square inch) of efficiency, and many have over 200 mpg (million pounds per square inch) of efficiency. The internal combustion engines of these days are very efficient, and many cars of that time have over 100 mpg of efficiency.\n\nClimate Change and Fuel Efficiency\n\nClimate change is another major concern of the modern era.

The internal combustion engines of these days are very efficient, and many cars of that time have over 100 mpg of efficiency. .........\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt = \"what is the education of MUHAMMED THAHSEER\"\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Generate the model's response\noutput = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)\n\n# Decode the output\nresponse = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(response,\".........\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt = \"how automobile industry has undergone for a tremendous changes?\"\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Move inputs to GPU if available\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\ninputs = {key: val.to(device) for key, val in inputs.items()}\nmodel.to(device)\n\n# Generate tokens step-by-step\nmax_length = 500\ngenerated = inputs[\"input_ids\"]\n\nfor _ in range(max_length):\n    outputs = model(generated)\n    next_token_logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]\n    next_token = torch.argmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)\n    generated = torch.cat((generated, next_token.unsqueeze(-1)), dim=-1)\n\n    # Decode and print the latest token\n    decoded_token = tokenizer.decode(next_token)\n    print(decoded_token, end=\" \", flush=True)\n\n    # If the model generates the end of sentence token, stop early\n    if next_token.item() == tokenizer.eos_token_id:\n        break","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-06T09:41:38.509044Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-06T09:41:38.509864Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-06T09:43:26.099637Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-06T09:41:38.509822Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-06T09:43:26.098599Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n \n Autom obile Indust ry Ch anges : \n \n The autom obile industry has under g one trem end ous changes since the in ception of the autom ob iles .
